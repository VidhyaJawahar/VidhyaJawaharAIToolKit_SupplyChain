    <p>The selected literature provides a comprehensive overview of Sustainable Supply Chain Management (SSCM)...</p>
    <p>Key works include Stindt’s (2017) integrated planning model, Ansari and Kant’s (2017) review and synthesis, and contributions by Dubey, Khan, and Rajeev, guiding future SSCM research.</p>
    <p>Studies like Mastos and Gotzamani (2022), and Mathivathanan et al. (2018), apply SSCM in industries like food and automotive. Technologies such as blockchain and e-business are rising, while challenges in developing economies demand strategic adoption.</p>
    <p>Future research should explore integration, performance tools, and cross-sector applications to scale SSCM globally.</p>
